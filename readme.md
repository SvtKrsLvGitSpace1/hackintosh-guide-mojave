# Hackintosh Build Guide for OSX Mojave - 10.14

Having had to rebuild my system this past weekend I thought I would document my journey for my Hackinstosh. This guide is intended as a roadmap as a fresh install for my developer setup.

## My System Specs

<img src="./hw.jpg" alt="Photo: so all my parts are finally in, time to get building!">

- NZXT Tempest 210 case
- GIGABYTE GA-Z87X-D3H motherboard
- Intel Core i5-4670K Haswell 3.4GHz
- 16GB memory
- Corsair CX500 Power Supply
- 256 SSD and 1TB HD

Hard to believe [this build is over 4years old][googleplus] and is still running great. Hackintosh's are kinda picky on hw so make sure you choose wisely. [Tonymacx86 Buyers Guide][buyersguide] is a great resource to choose from guaranteed working builds.

## Step One: Bootable USB
